-1,I loved the design and look to this shirt  but it ran way big for me. i loved the forgiving fit  but it just wasn't flattering at all. i even went down one size and it still was huge. sad to send this one back.,Blouses
-1,This is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on. fit perfectly as a size 6 should in the arms  shoulder  chest... then the waist was huge! just hung off of me like a flour sack. it was wider than the chest measurements  which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic. combine that with the high-low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject. sent back immediately  do not buy this if you have (or want to appear to have) an hourglass figure  it will do nothing for,Blouses
-1,"I have been looking for a nice  white tunic and i should have known when i saw this was one size fits all. maybe because i am petite (5'2"") but there was so much material hanging everywhere that it made me look even shorter and fat. who wants that? so sending it back.",Blouses
-1,This would be a great blouse for flat chested person. i am a size 12 and busty. i ordered an xl and it was ridiculously tight across the chest and the fabric is see through. you would need to wear a cami under it.,Blouses
-1,I tried on this top and it looked fine until i tried to move. you can't lift your arms. i tried on a larger size but still felt like the movement was limited in the back and arm areas.,Blouses
-1,I loved this tunic the first time i wore it. i ordered it in the red and it was very flattering on my post-pregnancy figure and extremely cute with leggings and boots - just what i wanted. it fit true to size  even with a few extra pounds around the chest area. imagine my horror when i pulled it out of the wash - having followed the directions on the tag exactly - and discovered it had shrunk and no longer fit properly. in particular the sleeves became incredibly  uncomfortably tight and much sh,Blouses
-1,I saw this very shirt online & thought it was so pretty. in person  the shirt seems flimsy. the buttons look as though they'd fall off. i also didn't like the cut of the shirt. it seemed to be tighter on top & looser on the bottom. had to return. i couldn't justify the cost with the quality.,Blouses
-1,While i love the design and shape of this blouse  the fabric was of very poor quality. i will return it.,Blouses
-1,I loved this top online and even more when i opened it up. however  the quality of the stitching is poor. where the seam comes together at the hip on both sides  the stitching is very loose and appears to be coming undone. i was bummed and am sending it back today.,Blouses
0,I really wanted to like this shirt but it doesn't seem to be of that great of quality and is much more sheer than indicated in the photographs. the shirt is very clingy and doesn't hang well. i sent it back,Blouses
0,First off  the other reviews are spot on regarding the quality of this top. the material is thick and pleasant feeling  the print is beautiful and the construction is nicely done. however  i just couldn't get past the fit issue  which was also mentioned by the other reviewers. i ordered a 14 for my 38 dd chest  and it was loose in all the wrong places. i'd be interested to see what a 12 looks like on me  but i'm afraid it would be too snug. this may look awesome on someone else  but i had to ret,Blouses
0,It's really cute but seems expensive for the type of fabric. i thought it would be more substantial. got lots of compliments .,Blouses
0,Fabric was a little more shear than i thought it would be - while not a big deal - it was missing a few of the silver beads along the front line of the top. returned,Blouses
0,The fit is slightly loose  but figure flattering  the fabric is semi sheer and the light  coral color is very pretty. however  after one  short wear i discovered fabric torn from both sides of the back seam. unfortunately  i need to return this blouse asap.,Blouses
0,"Thought i'd love this top; i'm a sucker for lace anything from retailer.  but i found the lace  while pretty  to be quite rough  which to me indicates a lower quality. and i guess i should've known that it would be very swingy (photos show that) but it really overwhelmed me.  for reference  5'5""  125 lbs  34d. sad  but this went back.",Blouses
0,I love a good peplum top  and was so excited when it arrived  but was sad to find the flare on the peplum was a little too much. i'm not sure why it was so unflattering  because in every other way  it fit like a dream  but it seemed like either there was too much or too little fabric around the waist to have it hang properly. it had to go back.,Blouses
0,I wanted to love this top to go with a pair of red flats i also bought at retailer. but it's almost like a peplum crop top because the cut is short. the peplum piece also flares out rather dramatically. had to return it even though i love other tops from maeve.,Blouses
0,I ordered this top because i liked the look in the back  however  the top i received looks nothing like the back. online it shows that the back has elastic & is gathered. also online it shows thin straps (that look like a bra strap) but my top has no thin straps & no elastic~ extremely odd!! i called customer service but the lady i spoke to didn't have any information or complaints about the top. i'm holding on to the top because it is cute from the front  but i was really wanting the back to lo,Blouses
1,This blouse is so beautiful and feminine. it fits loosely and is see thru  so you do need to wear a cami underneath it. it is very comfortable to wear. i got many compliments when i wore this blouse. all the delicate lace on it just makes you feel very pretty in it. however  be extra careful when you do wear it. i'm still not quite sure how it happened  but the lace in the front got a small hole right in the front on my first time wearing it. it's so pretty i just hope i can get it fixed so it w,Blouses
1,"I bought this top in ivory and love it! i'm 5'5"" 125lbs and 32dd. i usually wear a small or 4 but sized up to a 6..i have no issues with the fabric!! this is a steal for the sale price.",Blouses
1,"I saw this top at my local store and tried it on a whim. it is so much cuter in person than it looks online - i wouldn't have given it a second look based on these pictures... it perhaps runs a tiny bit large  but i stuck with my usual size small since it hung nicer on my body than the xs did. if you're thin you may want to size down - i have a decent amount of ""padding"" that keeps me from wanting to wear anything fitted (5'4""  130 lbs). the little dots are more prevalent in person and the peplu",Blouses
1,"I really love this shirt. the cutouts make it unique and the fabric is super soft for a chambray style. i thought the fit was perfect - i'm 5'5""  120lbs and i ordered an xs. still enough room to be comfortable. super cute! glad i bought it.",Blouses
1,"This shirt is very soft and fits nicely. as with a lot of maeve tops  the arms are a little snug so if you have muscular arms you'll definitely want to size up. it won't make the shirt too ""blousey"" because it will still look really cute tucked in in the front with ankle jeans and a trendy belt. i wish i had gotten this in the blue before it sold out because it is lovely!",Blouses
1,It lays very nicely on your body. very flattering!!!!,Blouses
1,"Fabulous with leggings. i am 5'1""  105 lbs and always wear pxs. the pxs was too large and fit like a ps  so order a size down. i really like it  and going to exchange for a smaller size.",Blouses
1,So soft!! such beautiful fabric!! it flows so gracefully and looks lovely with black leggings as pictured. one of my favorite retailer purchases to date...,Blouses
1,"Such a great purchase! the fit is so flattering to my 5'3"" frame. i usually wear an extra small/small  but i opted for an extra small after reading a review; i'm glad i did. i also did not get the petite  but i imagine it would have a similar fit without the length this has. it flows  yet hits my curves in all the right places. i will say  i'm a c cup and if you have larger breasts  the extra small may not accommodate them as it is just right on me. the black is so slimming especially when pared",Blouses
-1,I read all the reviews about the fabric being see through  but liked the dress enough to give it a shot. it is soooo see through. this trally could only be worn on a beach. very disappointed.,Dresses
-1,"This is a pretty dress  but the cut is quite boxy. i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then ""flare out"" more around the waist down to the hem; however  the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down  which lends to a rather unflattering look.",Dresses
-1,I loved the fact that this dress is cotton. it is a thin cotton  and you can see in the photos that she is wearing a black slip with a thicker strap. mine came with a nude slip. i'm thinking they all come with a nude slip. i'm not sure why they showed the dress with the black thick strap slip unless it was to show the dress as a thicker cotton than what it actually is. the dress is adorable though which makes it hard for me to decide whether to keep it and hope mine won't tear easily or to retur,Dresses
-1,I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail  i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online  the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat  i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!,Dresses
-1,Thought this would be a great dress for warm days  but alas it fit like a sack. love floreat and have a few of their well made dresses. shame this did nothing for my curves. ordered an 8  usually wear a 10 and it was a tad narrow in the shoulders. if you can sport a loose swingy shape  this is a great dress with nice detailing  but sadly the shape did not work for me.,Dresses
-1,I loved the look of this dress online so i went to retailer to try it on. in the dressing room area we were all laughing because (i tried on a small) when i got it tied to the point where it looked like the model online i couldn't raise my arms. the distance between the cuff and the waist is inches! even if you manage to lift your arms the whole dress will go with it and expose you as much as if you weren't wearing a dress at all but a shirt. too bad. poor design for sure  and such a shame when th,Dresses
-1,Gorgeous  but so big. i got eh pxs and it's like a mumu. i wiill return,Dresses
-1,The quality and fabric of this dress are lovely  but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless. it fit me like a sack  i ordered the m and i suppose i should've sized down  but even in the s i'm afraid this would be far too large. for reference  i am 5'7 and 135 lbs. i have a curvy build so this shape dress just wasn't right on me. i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure. returned.,Dresses
-1,I wanted to love this dress. the cut  fit and color are adorable. unfortunately the fabric is super thin. due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the anti-static spray your mom used to use in the 80s. i was on the fence of keeping it  but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your panty-line the whole world will see it. i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue. i am most likely going to return it; even at 15% off  it is over-priced for the cheap,Dresses
0,Ugh.  i was so excited to get this dress and for 30% off.  this dress is adorable.  unfortunately the top part is super tight around my girls.  otherwise the fit was perfect.  very disappointed in the top of this dress.,Dresses
0,I am pretty standard size 8  36c  5&amp;#39;6&amp;quot;  150 lbs. i ordered the small and the bust fit well but the whole thing was like a tent and way too flowy for my taste. it was also long so everything was very covered. i didn&amp;#39;t feel it flattered my build. i returned!,Dresses
0,I have a dress very like this from retailer's fall line.  i love it  so i decided to try this one. the fabric is thinner than the other dress  which is good for spring  but it also seemed not such a great quality. i also didn't care for the texture. if this doesn't bother you  the pattern is very cute and the style is flattering. it is cute with a blazer.,Dresses
0,I purchased this dress in my usual petite size 2. it fit me quite well for the most part  a bit tight around the armpit area but the major issue for me was with the front of the dress. there was a weird pocket of extra fabric under my chest area (i'm small chested). also  the bow across the back did not cover my bra strap (below the bow) which made me think i needed to size up. i'm not sure if that would have fixed the weird fit in the front but i just decided to return the dress in the end. the,Dresses
0,This dress has been one that i just adored online and in the store so i was happy when i bought it on sale. i have worn this dress one time  thinking that i would love it. the problem is that as i wore it  the dress continued to stretch out of shape and just did nothing for my curvy bottom half. the dress just looked pulled and stretched out of shape. i would say that it may be the yarn and that it has too much give or at least more give than i want.,Dresses
0,I love the style of this dress  but unfortunately  it runs very small. i normally wear a size 8. i ordered a 10 and the dress was closer to a size 6. disappointed that i had to return it. also  the seams were poorly done and threads hung out everywhere on the hem.,Dresses
0,May look better on someone tall. thin  and straight.,Dresses
0,I ordered the red version--it is incredibly cute  soft  vibrant  and a flattering a-line. however  this dress is sized oddly  running at least one or two sizes too small  particularly at the waistband. i ordered my usual size and one size up  and even the larger size was too snug in the waist.  yet at the same time  i had some gaping at the straps  and i have a full bust. even worse is the *impossible* side-zipper that is a workout to get past the seam at the waistband. trying to wrestle the zip,Dresses
0,"So sad!  this beautiful dress which i have been waiting to receive didn't work for me.  i'm a 5'7"" hourglass girl and it just made me look big!  but i love the pattern and the way it looks on the photo online!  so sad but will return it!0",Dresses
1,I was recently asked to be a speaker at an important fundraising event for homeless & abused women in our city. i wanted to appeal to the affluent crowd by my physical presentation  and let my words follow with a heartfelt presentation of the value & worth of these precious ladies.    retailer has continually helped me present polished & professional  yet still show my personal style & inclusive nature.    it gives me that extra edge of authenticity & encouragement to do the most w/what has,Dresses
1,I am usually a 00 or 0 in dresses  and i ended up with a 4 in this one. i could barley zip up the 0  and while i could have gotten away with the 2  there is no elasticity in the waistband. the 4 is very slightly roomy  but more comfortable than the smaller sizes on me. for reference  i'm 109-111 lbs  5'4  and a 30b.     when i was finally able to wear the dress  i got compliments galore. it really is a beautiful dress! just be sure to size up!,Dresses
1,I recommend this dress for women wth a small bust. this is an absolutely gorgeous dress  but it runs very small through the bodice and is almost empire waisted. if you remember the coral dress from spring by the same designer  it fits the same but this one has a tiered skirt. so sad- i love this dress-the colors and design are beautiful.,Dresses
1,I love  love  love this brand. these people know how to cut and construct a dress. i'm apple-shaped and have trouble finding fitted dresses that flatter me  but this one makes me look curvy and hides my flaws. the pattern lays perfectly and will make you look great. the fabric is high-quality and fully-lined. it's perfect for work or for going out. i love that it's black and bronze-y  because i can wear it with black or brown accessories. i'm generally between a l/xl in retailer and the l fits wel,Dresses
1,Someone returned my size so i got to try it on in store. the cut is very flattering  the material is stretchy. the lace part is nicely made too. overall great piece. the petite waist did hit me a little higher than on model  i have a regular torso and short legs (and overall usually need petite),Dresses
1,This is the little black dress i've been looking for for years -- great slim fit (runs small -- i usually get sized out but the 00 was a snug fit)  eye-catching design. like the other reviewer  i think solid black panels rather than floral brocade would have been classier  but overall a chic dress.,Dresses
1,"Great dress  nicely structured  but the fabric is very thick and since it's lined  it's a very ""warm"" dress. not something you would wear in the spring  especially in the summer. ordered in petite  so hem length was perfect on me (i'm 5').",Dresses
1,I bought this in the green and i had to try a few to get one that sat well- in fact i tried on a size above my normal size and that particular dress was shorter and tighter than my normal size. when i reordered my normal size  it was a pretty good fit. i kept the dress but am still on the fence on whether or not i should actually keep it- it took so long to find one that fit well that it missed the holiday events where i'd hoped to wear it.,Dresses
1,I worry when i have an elastic waist  or something that resembles this  but the dress hangs like a dream. no puffing out  no gathers that you can see. it is not sheath  but not a line either  kind of in between  hits several inches above my knees  but perfect with some black tights for winter. i saw the note about grey  have to try it on agin in daylight  but i would say think black on the top  light camel color on the bottom i am 5'8  typically wear a size 12  and it was true to size for me the,Dresses
-1,I agree with the other reviewer. the colors were fabulous  but it was boxy and fit me like a sack. the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits. it was really a cute idea and i'm sad it didn't work. i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance --i should have listened !,Fine gauge
-1,"This is a very pretty sweater  a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1"" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look.",Fine gauge

-1,The fit of this sweater did not flatter my body-type. the top half did not fit well; the armpit area was loose fitting and the neckline was awkward.,Fine gauge
-1,I really liked the design. ordered a medium which was huge. also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material -- a bit itchy. returned it.,Fine gauge
-1,Much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo. when i pulled it out of the package i thought i'd ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow. but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly  with beautiful detail and high quality material  but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape. it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion. it doesn't look anything like the phot,Fine gauge
-1,I wanted to love this. however  the fit was funky and the colors were muted. this is definitely something you must try on in the store. too risky to buy online due to weird fit.,Fine gauge
-1,How cute was this little sweater and comfortable even in the south .... until i washed it! i followed the instructions on the label being careful not to wring it out. first of all  the smell was unbelievable! i washed it three days ago and it is still wet and damp and on top of that  it shrunk. even though i handwashed it  line dried it and pampered it to no end!,Fine gauge
-1,Based on the strength of the other reviews  i thought this sweater would be amazing  but i was disappointed. the knit is very thin  cheap looking and weak that it won't last a season undamaged. it reminds me of a duster i bought 15 years ago at a discount fast-fashion retailer when i was a student. sloppy looking with lots of creases out of the package. collar is odd and the sleeve openings have an annoying flare. the drape is not structured enough--everything about this screams over priced bath,Fine gauge
0,"This is a very lightweight  comfy sweater jacket. i wanted to love but didn't find it ""special"" enough for the price. i am usually between a small and medium and tried on both sizes in the gray and the navy. the small fit snug in the shoulder but i liked how the layering showed at the bottom of the front. that look was lost on the medium  though the general fit was better. in the end  the looked medium too sloppy for my taste  and the small felt too small.",Fine gauge
0,I bought this sweater in dark grey in the store. i really loved it at first - it's very soft and cozy and fits really well. i especially like that it's long enough to cover my tummy and butt when i wear skinny jeans or leggings. however  the other reviews that mention it gets fuzz all over the place are accurate. i doubt i would have bought this if i had read them first. it even has dark grey fuzz in the inside of the sleeves. however  my biggest disappointment is that after just one wearing  th,Fine gauge
0,This is really cute but does run large  if your in between sizes size down. the fabric at the front is super bulky but with a smaller size could be ok? it is so itchy  imo uncomfotably so! i would have returned for a smaller size had it not been so uncomfortable  ugh why! i loved the sleeves  very cute bell. and the back hung nicely. they need to make this in a cotton  vocoder and no wool! loved bit couldnt bear it.,Fine gauge

0,"I'm usually a small (5'5""  116 lbs  long torso)  but the x-small fit well. the black does look see-through in the pictures  but i figured i could wear a cami with it. it is see-through in person if you are up close  mainly in the back and arms since the front has extra fabric in places. however  it is rather short  possibly because it is an x-small  and i'll need a short cami to fit under it or will have to have a cami hanging out of the bottom  which drapes nicely and a cami may mar that effect",Fine gauge
0,Bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost. fabric feels cheap  like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly. did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack. gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag. returned it.,Fine gauge
0,I like the look of this sweater and i am keeping it. however  i found the fit under the arms a little uncomfortable. there is a large seem that goes under the armpit and is a little bulky and irritating. also would not recommend if you are busty. because of how the stripes run  it looks stretched out over my chest.,Fine gauge
0,I love the style of this top. hand washed before wearing and it looks like a rag before i even got to wear it. very disappointed since i thought it would be a very practical tank.,Fine gauge
0,This thing sheds so much it's almost unuseable but i used an entire roll of sticky roller and got it to the point where i could wear it with only a glob of fuzz on my underwear not other people's couches. it's cute and fits well other than that. buy a sticky roller!,Fine gauge
1,"Wasn't expecting this to look good on when i grabbed it off the sale rack. to my surprise it's very cute. the very high up slits for the 2 front panels and the lightweight knit break up the heavy appearance of this poncho when it's on. you can slip your arms out of the sleeves to keep warm when the evening gets cooler. i love it. got the gray and black stripes on off white background. will try belting the two front panels  as another reviewer suggested. i'm 5'3"" petite. so  it doesn't swallow me",Fine gauge
1,I love this top! although it is a tad big  i expected this because the moth brand usually does run a tad big. however  i am still able to wear it without any nerves that it's too big.... hope that makes sense! the navy was more lovely with my skin + hair  but the yellow was so pretty too!,Fine gauge

1,Bought this sweater as soon as i saw it. the knit ribs and the length help slim your lines. it is flattering even on my heavier mid section. the material is airy but not see through (yay!) i love that the deep v-neck with collar is not too deep for the office. i would buy another if another color becomes available. perfect spring to summer sweater,Fine gauge

1,I love the tie-dye look! i ordered the blue color in my usual size small. fit is tts. love it!. just a fyi: 1. on mine  one arm is a darker blue tie-dye  the other is very light (color variation). 2. the white band on the mock-neck doesn't give much  so be careful when putting on/taking off.  i think it's pricey  but ordered during the promo so that made it better. it came yesterday  put it on w/ my washed blue skinny jeans  out to dinner we went!,Fine gauge
1,It fits perfectly  slim but not clingy  and it has a beautiful pattern/texture to it. its surprisingly warm for how thin it is and its a great layering piece.,Fine gauge
-1,The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.,Intimates
-1,I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay  but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store  i would have passed over it. however  i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies  though!,Intimates
-1,Fun  sexy underwear but rides up in the front. will return,Intimates
-1,3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,Intimates
-1,It seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment. however  i found the band to be extremely small and tight. it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin.,Intimates

0,I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.,Intimates
0,It is a very pretty bra. light weight and beautiful lace. however  i have yet to find a t-back that does not make me feel like i am going to spill out. to me it ran small. i now know to get a 34 instead. i am working on losing weight  perhaps that might help with the fit?,Intimates
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
0,As a petite  big busted woman  i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful  though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however  i found unflattering.,Intimates
0,Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute  it's not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit.,Intimates
0,"The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical.",Intimates

1,Love this bra! i was looking for something feminine and sexy and this is perfect. it's exactly as pictured. i was worried the material would be too delicate and fragile  but it's really durable! my only issue is that it fits a tiny bit awkwardly because of the solid material on the side  but it doesn't actually look awkward  just feels a bit odd at first. i highly recommend it if you're looking for something sweet and sexy!,Intimates
1,I honestly just love the hanky panky brand. i know it sometimes feels a little extravagant to purchase their lingerie  but the quality  fit and style are so good that it is absolutely worth it. this piece is no exception. i don't normally purchase lingerie like this  but saw this chemise and decided to try it. just as the other pieces from this brand  it's comfortable and gorgeous- so high quality and classy. it's a great cut  the fabric is clearly lace  but beautifully done. and the feel is lov,Intimates

0,Ordered my regular size large and the fit was a snug around my hips when snapped. i didn't plan on wearing it that way so that wasn't a deal breaker for me. but because i have a larger bust i felt the padding added pounds and lots of width to my frame. i also had the same issues with coloring as other reviewers. and lastly  the collar is really high and it just bugged me. so this one went back.,Jackets

0,Delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness. loved the unmatched buttons  checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy. easyily dress it up or down  that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight. i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build. ordered a 4 but i think a 6 would have been perfect!,Jackets
0,This design looks really sharp on the image  but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi.  the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap.  since the fabric was pretty soft  with a gray jersey lining  it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer.      i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b  i felt like i was busting out of a size 8  and i am a 34d.,Jackets

-1,I had such high hopes  but they are just slightly off. they run a tad large  so i suggest sizing down. (i usually wear a 28 or 29  and the 28 fit nicely through the hips and thighs.)  unfortunately  the color is off- i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue  but they are actually gray. and they have a button-fly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion. i will be returning them.,Jeans

-1,The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however  the fabric  despite 2% spandex  has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4')  i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear  i think they would cut off the circulation.  please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.,Jeans

-1,This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came,Layering
-1,Very poorly made- wide and short  very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton  but it felt very synthetic.,Layering
-1,Doesn't feel like cotton jersey. feels like a thin version of the seamless cami. it's not soft as i expected. it's much thinner than expected too.,Layering
-1,"This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder  though. the arms themselves are really long  far past my hands  yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference  i am 5'10""  130 pounds and ordered a small  which is what i usually need.",Layering
-1,This top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace. it would be a great top to use as loungewear  though.,Layering
-1,I wore this bodysuit once. it had a hole under the arm when i took it off,Layering
0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering
0,So comfortable and soft but starting pilling after one wear! sending back.,Layering
0,I love the way the mock neck style looks  but the shirt is cut very small. i realize it's supposed to stretch  but it's still very  very tight on  particularly in the shoulder area. if you like the style  i'd recommend sizing up.,Layering
0,I was looking for an undergarment and this is more of a nightgown. if it came in a solid color then i'd probably buy it. i usually wear a small and this was a tad too tight. on the upside  the fabric was soft and lightweight.,Layering
0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering
0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",Layering
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering
0,I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great  soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.,Layering
1,This is one of the softest shirts ever! i agree with another reviewer about the shirt not worth the original price but once this shirt hit the sale item  totally worth it.,Layering
1,Like the look of this tank  ran a bit larger than expected at the neck but overall happy with the purchase,Layering
1,"I love this dress. i'm 5'8"" and it fits me exactly like the model in the picture. i have slim hips and waist  so that helps. i don't think this would be as flattering on someone curvy. i wish it came in another color i like  i would absolutely buy in another color. i got a medium and it fits like a glove.",Layering
1,This is one of those pieces of clothing that is destined to become a wardrobe staple. the fabric is soft and generous. . the chiffon trim gives it swing and style. i just ordered another one because i know it is going to be a long time favorite..,Layering
1,"I'm 5'5"" 127lbs. ordered size small. not sheer. bodysuit snaps. great to wear with skirts and wide leg pants!!",Layering
1,Actually you would think just another tshirt but actually with the wide straps it changes it up enough to really be cute.  i like the look it adds.  i really want to get more colors.   i normally wear everything from retailer in small   and even though this fit it was small for a small.  i will keep it but i think i will buy others in medium.,Layering
1,I have bought 4 of these  but after 1st wash on 2 of them and they were in a lingere bag  there are little holes on the front of each  now they are bum around shirts. if they go on sale i will purchase  but the material needs to be better.,Layering
1,I bought the black one on an extra 40% off sale and i just love it! not thrilled about the other colors  but i might order another one just because i like it so much. super soft and comfy. i had to order a size up since the mediums were all sold out  but i like the way it fits. not too big at all.,Layering
1,Great soft basic. low scoop neck makes this tank flirty while the thicker strap keeps it modest. i absolutely love this top  easily dress up and down!,Layering
-1,So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small  which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately  i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~,Legwear
-1,The tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo. one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing. very disappointing. i wish i had found the hole before i try them on. they are definitely going back.,Legwear
-1,"These socks were so narrow  especially on top  that they pinched my thighs and we're almost painful to wear all day. my thighs are pretty narrow  i'm only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body. i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they don't slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny. ""one size"" is definitely not true. they also snag easily.",Legwear
-1,I opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on. the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee  it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees. someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them. they were obviously too small for whoever did that. these never should have been resent to another customer. they are obviously very misshapen. they are going back. on a bet,Legwear
-1,These socks were very thin and the elastic at the top was very rigid. i could not get these socks to go any higher than half-way up my calf. i would not recommend this product. it felt very cheap and not of good quality.,Legwear
-1,Good quality fabric and structure but the mix media details and lines make them seem more like jodphurs than leggings. it's hard to see where i would wear them ... sorry but they have to go back.,Legwear
-1,I wanted to love these  they are cute and warm - but they have absolutely no elasticity. i'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping 2 pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store.,Legwear
-1,Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing  the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up.,Legwear
-1,Does not say ribbed. did not want ribbed. would not have bought ribbed,Legwear
0,"I received these as a christmas gift. they are really cozy: warm  soft and super comfortable. however  they stretch out a lot  as there is no drawstring or elastic on the waist band. this leads them to poof out a lot and i have to keep pulling them up. this is fine for hanging out around the house  but not if you want to wear them out and about. i'm keeping them because they're so comfortable  but beware how much they stretch. (i am 5'6""  130 lbs and the size small fits well).",Legwear
0,I love the fabric and design of these leggings  but unfortunately they ran way to big up top. they literally fall down.,Legwear
0,These leggings are great in quality and are thick enough to wear as pants; the rise is perfect. the only issue is that they stretch during wear and end up being a size larger.,Legwear
0,"I am 5' 10"" 135 lbs  normally a size 4l and ordered both a small in the navy and a medium in the beige. the elastic waist on both is not a tight/ muffin-top producing elastic like on some thinner banded leggings. in fact  the elastic is very loose  not very stretchy on either of the sizes. i think the s had been previously tried on  given the state of the packaging and the fact that the seat of the pant was already a bit stretched out. the m is definitely too large so i would say that these run",Legwear

0,I have bought other leggings at retailer and they were fine. these run small. i have to return.,Legwear
0,I wanted to love these  but they're so tight around the top. my legs are normal size and i couldn't get them above my knee. the top isn't stretchy...it has a string that keeps it from expanding. they are so very cute  but unfortunately must go back for me.,Legwear
0,I've never owned sweater leggings before so these were my first. i had to order large because well i have some junk in the trunk (am 10/12 on bottom and 8 on top). these are a teeny bit scratchy but i'm hoping with a wash they'll soften up--but they're really loose too so i'm also hoping they'll shrink a teensy bit.,Legwear
1,I am wearing these as i type this. they are unbelievably cozy. would wear them as loungewear if it weren't for the fact that they also look so so cute and i want to wear them out. so soft and a really good fit. higher than my other leggings so i don't have to pull them up ever. but also just really fashionable looking. love!!! one of my favorite retailer purchases ever.,Legwear
1,I really liked these leggings  so comfy! they are so soft and the waistband is thick(about an inch wide). i am a size 10 in pants  i got a size m. i have a 33 inch inseam and these came down to my ankles. these leggings have textured stripes at the calf and hip.,Legwear
1,These are just perfect  exactly as pictured if not nicer. very soft and comfy with a big sweater on for winter months.,Legwear

1,These socks feel amazing-i have them in both colors.  you would be surprised at the softness of these socks  yet they are slightly thicker than normal dress socks. i have weird toenails that tend to pierce through the tops of socks so a thicker sock is something that is very attractive to me. i feel like these would last a long time  with the bonus of making my feet feel like they are at the spa-these socks are soft?  these socks do not stay on my thigh so i have to use a garter and wear them li,Legwear
1,36dd  10/12 in tops  12/14 in bottoms  bought size m/l very cute pattern on the grey leggings  and the fleece lining is warm. they are thick too  so even stretched they are not see through. i would say 14 would be as large as these bottoms would fit as they are snug  but fine for wearing under skirts and dresses.,Legwear
-1,Fabric felt and looked cheap.  hem was completely frayed  all the way around  perhaps purposely  but ratty looking  all the same.,Lounge
-1,White and silver threads made fabric look grey. almost dirty. fit was nice and price is great. villa to pool to restaurant would be great. colored fabric would be better.,Lounge
-1,Just wanted to review so people know this hoodie has a zipper. it's very soft and comfy but i was looking for a pullover hoodie and am disappointed that once again retailer's picture doesn't match the actual product. it does fit true to size however.,Lounge
-1,These pants looked worn  washed & old looking when i received them! the quality is super thin cotton as if it's been washed a million times & is about to fall apart! the workmanship is terrible. you can see loose stitching all over. the top portion is too tight & looks terrible stretched out. i liked absolutely nothing about this pants except the idea of them from the picture online...,Lounge
-1,I'm 5'3 and ordered the small. as soon as i saw it in person  i knew it was an item to return. the material is too transparent  and designed to wear with undergarments or swim gear that you want people to see. it was way too long for me. i think it would work for a taller person. i just didn't feel it was worth the money for the quality and transparency.,Lounge
-1,I thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed. i am 5'7 and i usually wear a size small top and 4 dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge!! i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasn't expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack. i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad. i was so upset. it also has thin silver lines through it which  for me  m,Lounge
-1,I purchased this in the yellow xs. it is very comfortable  but extremely see-through. you'd have to wear a slip or something underneath it  but i'm not sure what would work based on the style  and even if i wore a strapless bra it was still see-through. unfortunately i had to return it.,Lounge
-1,I would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker. it's really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress. you can't wear a bra with it because it is backless so i don't understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house.,Lounge
-1,"This dress is horrible. i can't believe they can get away with calling it a ""dress"". it should have been called a tunic or shirt. it looks like it is a soft flowing dress made out of nice material from the pictures  no way. it is made from sweatshirt material it is lifeless and is kind of stiff. it came to the top of my thighs. i can't find one nice thing to say about this dress and i do not recommend it. the picture does it so much more justice that it is worth.",Lounge
0,Beautiful color and softness  very warm  but the front is way too much material. it just wasn't flattering the way i wanted it to be. perhaps on a taller woman this would work.,Lounge

0,I was hopeful my size l would fit after another pair of leggings from antrho in this order was too small. these went on easier and i was feeling good until i reached the lower abdomen and everything came to a screeching halt. i'm not sure they are too small  rather  i believe  they are styled to be low-rise. not sure why anyone would want that in a legging  but i'm new to this athletic-wear trend. regardless  i won't be wearing these!,Lounge
0,The one i tried on had something wrong with the pockets... one was regular height t eh other was so low  i could barely put my hand in it. however  the jumpsuit itself is really pretty and soft. color is nice  but hard ot pull off on pale skin like me.  i tried on the xs  but that was big. i would need xxs p if it was made in that size  so i let it go...

0,I loved the design of these pants  and got them to go with the matching jacket. the problem with them is there isn't enough stretch to keep them up. i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up  as they would slide down. the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist.,Lounge
0,I was really disappointed when this arrived and i discovered that it's basically see-through.  it's well constructed  it's just a really thin material.,Lounge
0,I practically live in lounge pants  and i like the unique style of this wide-leg version. i'm generally a 6/28 in pants and ordered the small which fit well  if a bit big. the overall fit is great - slim at the hip with a nice wide waistband  and flatteringly-placed dropped pockets. the pants really slim my hips and provide a nice silhouette with the wide legs. the fabric is soft and flows and i did not experience any sheerness. as for color - i would call these a deep cool brown  definitely not,Lounge
0,I am on the fence about this one. the length is great. it hits right above my knee at 5'1. overall it was larger than i was hoping. the waist is pretty loose  and i really had to tightly tie the back to get s good shoulder fit. the bottom is very voluminous making me look wide. i wish they had it in a petite size. for this price  i will probably return it. it's not worth the 300 price tag.,Lounge
0,I wish i could wax poetic about this gorgeous cardigan. i would have happily bought it in both colors except for the deal-breaking design flaw - the extremely tight sleeves. even if you have stick-thin arms  i don't know how you would ever be able to wear anything other than a tank top under it. sadly for me  this was a no go :(,Lounge
1,This is my favorite shirt to wear around the house. it's so soft and the waffle texture looks nice  i'd definitely wear it for a run to the store or an evening walk around the neighborhood. the fabric is thin but isn't too delicate and it's not sheer  which makes it a great summer lounge shirt. the cut is flattering and the back doesn't show my bra  which too many of this design do. it is a bit large  you may want to size down if you want it to be a bit more body conscious.,Lounge
1,"The colors on these leggings are very nice and the fit was fabulous. the waist is high enough to hold in a slight ""muffin"" top and the control in the fabric is just right. i received several compliments on them and hubby really liked them.",Lounge
1,I ordered the tangerine color of this tank. it's a great color  slightly heathered.    what i like most about this tank are the riders straps and the depth of the scoop neck. it allows for a normal bra and could be dressed up or down.    i wore the tank out and about  and it was comfy and pretty. later  though  my husband came home and asked if i knew it was see through. eek! sure enough  it is pretty sheer in certain lights. next time  i will wear a cami underneath. though i wish it were a bit,Lounge
1,These are very comfy and can be worn casual or dressed up. love the pom poms.,Lounge
1,First off  these are great because they are not so tight like all other work out crops that my anatomy is not a mystery to people around me. i have an athletic build and these pants are awesome in that they hug the body lightly. they are so soft and comfy also. perfect for running and the gym and apres whatever. i bought a back up pair.,Lounge
1,This dress has really great features--the style is adorable  and i love the color. the contrasting color straps are a nice feature. the only thing i don't like about it is that it's a rather thin material. not quite sure yet if i should wear it as a dress or simply as a swim cover-up.,Lounge
1,I was a bit confused with all the reviews here. some said this runs small and others said it runs big i decided to go to the store and try it. i'm 5'6 and 112 lbs. i'm usually size 2 or xs. when i tried the blue one  xs is very tight on the arm and i would have to size up if i ever want to wear a sweater underneath. however  when i tried the beige one  xs fits me well with some room for sweater. either one is beautiful. great quality as you would expect from this brand.,Lounge
1,"Really fun comfortable pants. i haven't worn them yet as its hot here but i can't wait. i tried them on with wedge sandals & a lacey bohemian top and they looked awesome. i also tried them on with white rocker booties and my vintage t that says ""italians do it better"" and a jean jacket...i'm loving the look & feel of them  bring on the cool autumn days.",Lounge
1,I love the design of these. the laser cut outs are solid and hold up in the wash. they are great for work-outs and cute enough to wear as leggings out. i wore them to my bar method class  came home and just changed my top and continued wearing them the rest of the day as a cute outfit. they have a great snug fit and the fabric is thick and durable.,Lounge
-1,"I totally agree with the last reviewer. i'm 5'2"" 115 pounds with somewhat wide shoulders. the x-small fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i couldn't move my arms. the small was better but was too big in the torso. the material itself was really nice. too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering.",Outerwear
-1,Ordered a size medium as i usually take a medium in retailer coats- the wool is wonderful however the stripped bands are sewn into the fabric which add to the weight. the coat has an odd shape - not a line or straight. the medium was large on me. the bottom edges of the coat did not line up when buttoned and there was no inside hook or button to help even out the bottom edges. sadly this coat will be returned.,Outerwear
-1,Thought i would splurge on a tracy reese coat. i got a size small  (120  5'6) felt huge on me and i looked like a wooly mammoth. very unflattering. another reviewer also mentioned on how it flairs slightly at the bottom?.adding to the overall bad look. i had it on for about 20 seconds and put it back in the bag to return. din't have to ponder about it at all.,Outerwear
-1,I was excited to receive this coat for my annual travel to switzerland but hesitated to order it online without seeing it first due to the price. it arrived last night with the buttons falling off and a large hole in the front pocket. the lining inside is has a very cheap plasticky feel and i can also see small rips possibly forming in the lining. in addition  the collar on the coat is extremely bulky and the shoulders are padded underneath the fur which makes ones shoulders appear like a lineba,Outerwear
-1,This coat is awful  just awful. i bought it based on the reviews  my husband said it looks like i am wearing a mattress. it looked awful. i really really liked the softness and that it wasn't like another puffer coat  it was also stretchy and the buttons super easy to wear  but the look  style  and design make it very unflattering. it looked so bad that i took it off right away. so disappointing!,Outerwear
-1,"I agree with other reviewers. it is beautiful but too tight around the chest. i am usually an xsmall and the xsmall was tight in the chest. i bought the small and it was still uncomfortable. sadly i had to return it. i am 5'4""  134 lbs and a 34c  by no means i am considered big chested so this is highly unusual.",Outerwear
-1,Darling jacket/coat  similar styling as the beige with big flowers and lace-up back that i bought a few years ago and still love. i was considering this one  but the description says to hand wash. seriously? a coat? that's simply not practical. not sure if i will buy this one.,Outerwear
-1,I love the colors and style of this poncho  however  the fabric is a total miss.  it is so scratchy  i developed a serious rash within the first 1/2 hour of wering it. also  unfortunately  the fabric is not woven tightly  so the poncho does not keep you warm  the wind whips right through it. it is disappointing that while the styles of retailer have remained top  the quality of their clothing has steadly gone down the hill. i hope retailer will put more effort in bringing the quality back.,Outerwear
-1,Even in my usual petite small size  this looked bulky and made me look stumpy. disappointing because the style looks so good in the picture and the material looks to be good quality. i don't even know if going down a size would have helped. as others have mentioned it looks like a frumpy house robe.,Outerwear
0,"I'm all over this trend  but this vest is quite thick/poufy  and on me i feel like it triangles out and all you see is furball. i love it - but i think you need some height for this to look its best. on me  a sweater vest would perhaps be better. i am chesty. but i cant decide. its really cute! if you're taller than 5'4"" don't hesitate.",Outerwear
0,Too much of a good thing is...still too much. there's too much flounce on this jacket for me--the waist sits slightly high  and the incredible amount of fabric beneath it (when you twill around  it's basically a full circle) makes my hips look huge. if there were about 1/3rd (not 1/2  but 1/3) the amount of fabric to the skirt  i'd be totally in love.   as it is  i'll be returning it.,Outerwear
0,I just loved this when i saw it in store. beautiful fabric  lovely color. i ordered a small petite because petite xs was sold out. i imagine it might be a little better if it were a size smaller  but there is sooo much fabric in the pleated bottom  unless you are blessed with exceptionally long legs  it might end up looking like a witches coat. at least that is what i was told by my daughter.,Outerwear
0,This coat is absolutely beautiful - an instant stunner. the style is very classy and timeless. it is definitely more of a lightweight coat than true cold weather wear. yes  it does run large  but that is the cozy look of it. it is not meant to be form-fitting. my one gripe is that - especially at the price point - if it's not going to be especially warm  it should at least be otherwise functional. the coat i received has pockets cut on the outside  but they are sewn shut. a coat without pockets?,Outerwear

0,I love the pattern on this jacket and enjoy the bell shape. a fun jacket to through on and add quick style to a skinny pants.,Outerwear
0,It seems this coat could have been manufactured under a smaller spec size because the size large looses shape and where it hits on the waistline is unflattering. quality is high however,Outerwear
0,I thought this would be so clean looking  in a theory/vince. menswear way  but unfortunately the cut of the coat is super unflattering. i waiver between a 2 and a 4 at retailer and erred on the side of caution and went with the 4. the shoulders are way off the mark  sleeves are too long  and the button hits about 3 inches too low. it's just...baggy...in a way that the size itself is not the issue. alas  this is going back  and my search for the perfect coat continues!,Outerwear
1,I wasn't sure the shorter length in the back was working until i tried it on. this jacket totally worked for me. the brown color can be easily matched with other colors. i got the jacket in medium size. i usually in between size. the medium size allow more space on the chest area  however the sleeve becomes a bit too long for me.,Outerwear
1,This coat is simply beautiful. i love the slits on the sides  it makes it unique and sexy. i would suggest that you go up a size so the silhouette is not disturbed by any pulling or tugging. i'm so happy with my purchase!,Outerwear

1,It goes without saying that trenches are timeless. but this one broke the mold with its femininity in the flare and the (finally!) different color. i saw this and put it in my cart  debated  and went back a few days later (as i always end up doing  because i could not live without it) and it was no longer available! i was devastated and could have kicked myself. but i waited a bit longer  went back on the website and thank god - retailer had ordered more from the designer and had replenished stock,Outerwear

-1,I usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand. they are lightweight  sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body. this brand can run big  so i usually buy a size 2 rather than my normal size 4. i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first  but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes: 26 and 27 because they didn't label them 2  4  6 etc. anymore. these pants still look well made and have cute little details  but they are bigger than ever!! the 27's,Pants

-1,I am sooooooo massively disappointed in this purchase. i thought i had found the perfect pant in this style. both more comfortable and more flattering than similar styles in the store. i wanted to wear them every day; received lots of compliments; felt that you could dress up or down; etc. this is where i have to admit that i wore them several times straight from the store before washing. on the second wear  i noticed threads coming out on the seams  but just on one side of one leg. this was irr,Pants
-1,I am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes! i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips... but for those of us with curves (i'm a size 12  hourglass)  these are very unflattering. they made me look like i was carrying an extra 20-30 pounds  just around the hips! so bummed because they look so cute on the model.,Pants

-1,I loved this romper so much! the material is thin  but perfect for summer. the style is just what i was looking for. it's so so cute and fit perfectly...at first. i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition. it went from loose and flowy  like on the model  to little booty shorts and a body suit...not the look i was going for. i am so disappointed.,Shorts

-1,Beware. white is not white. white is more cream  off-white  light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute  but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer  but unfortunately  creamy colored shorts don't do much for navy/white tops.also  the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok.,Shorts

-1,Looked really cute on the hanger  so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft  and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it.,Shorts

0,I'm pretty disappointed in these. just bought the yellow pair and wore today for the first time. super cute and very comfortable. i was in love with them. they got two small stains on them from the day's activities ( and not even crazy  untreatable stains). unfortunately  the stains did not budge yet the color of the shorts washed out. they are completely ruined after one washing (on cold). i'm hoping this was a fluke and plan to order a second pair before they sell out. these will be going back,Shorts

0,I love the look and feel of these shorts - typically my issue with any sort of cotton or linen shorts these days is that they're practically made of nothing  but these are comfortable and made of decent fabric. however  they run very large. being 100 lbs and about 5'  i typically buy size 0 or xs  but these looked a bit ridiculous on me  with how big they are. i tried shrinking them in the wash  since they're 100% cotton  and that helped some  along with getting rid of the creases from shipping,Shorts
0,Fabulous fabric  adorable details. fitting is very  very odd. it's non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose  but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over  the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i'd get a larger size  but then i can't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall ,Shorts
0,"This was so ridiculous on me. i'm 5'8"" 120 usually a 2/xs. so i ordered the xs. the inseam of the shorts are so short they barely cover my bum. and i mean barely. the romper itself was so wide that two of me could have fit in it.  love the colors  fabric  and the non-elasticized waist. if you are under 5'5"" this might work for you in non-petite sizing.",Shorts
0,These shorts are just beautiful. with that said  they were expensive  but made reasonable when i snagged them in the online sale! they do also run large  and they seem to be made for short-waisted bodies. i will be bringing them back to my local store to (hopefully) exchange for a smaller size. fingers crossed that they still have them in stock!,Shorts
0,I'm keeping these shorts because they are cute. i sized down as the previous reviews suggested and they fit great  but they are snug around the legs. i think i would have preferred a more baggy look  but then they would have been too big around the waist (had i ordered my typical size). they are soft and comfortable  the navy color is really pretty.,Shorts

1,I love these shorts! i know reviews say to size down and yes you very well could. but i like my shorts a little bigger so they hang on the waist and can wear a belt. they are so comfortable and the length is perfect! i love that they are loose around the thigh so they don't ride up while walking. i think they might look silly rolled down because they are so wide. i wish they had black  army green  and a dark wine. i would be in heaven!! i got the dark grey and the navy and am very happy.,Shorts

1,I have vowed to only purchase high-waisted bottoms from here on out because they are just more in line with my style! these shorts did not disappoint. i love that they're versatile enough to wear with a cute top + wedges or with a t-shirt and flats. great find! (i got my normal sz. 25 which is usually a tight fit  these zipped up perfectly though!),Shorts
1,Retailer rarely disappoints and this jumpsuit is a perfect example! i ordered a small based on reviews that it runs large and i do not like tight shorts and it was the right decision. the fabric  design and overall style make this piece easy to dress up or down. i cant wait to wear it. if you are on the fence order it now because this will not last long.,Shorts
-1,This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big  but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together  almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple  and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!,Skirts
-1,This skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away. i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on  but was disappointed by the awkward ruching. if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband (thereby also shortening it to knee length)  it would have been lovely. it should be noted that this is midi-length  which is awkward on me. i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely.,Skirts
-1,I really loved this skirt on the model  but it just wasn't flattering when i received my order. i ordered two sizes - 2 and 4. i am 5'4  athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is. the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to.     sadly  i had to return both. perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame.,Skirts

-1,"I absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt  if only the cut wasn't so odd. the sides of the skirt ""wing out"" for a very distracting and unflattering look. the stiff  felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse. in that respect  the model photos are not at all accurate. it also runs large. i had to go down one full size.",Skirts
-1,I ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile. when it arrived the pleat in front (shown in the center) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked. not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that's the true design but it will have to go back. too bad because i had high hopes!,Skirts
-1,This skirt looks great on  i didn't even think before buying it  planning to wear it all summer. so the aesthetic is great. quality and design  not so much. you get exactly one good wear out of it before the folding absolutely disintegrates  it is not sewn in or built to last.     then  it looks like a cheap sarong over a cheap miniskirt. i thought the dry cleaner might be able to fix it  but they said they would have to resew the whole garment  not exactly what you want to hear with almost bran,Skirts

1,"I am 5'6"" and run between a size 9-10 pant. i ordered the size 10 skirt and the waist fit perfectly and so did the back of the skirt  which i was afraid might be loose (i don't really have a butt but it fits nicely). looks like the picture so the skirt goes straight down  it does not taper to smaller width like some regular pencil skirts might so the bottom part will not be fitted  for your reference. the denim actually has quite a lot of stretch so it's very comfortable as well as the waistband",Skirts

1,This is a unique blouse and well worth a try. it is pure wool  so dry clean only. though it is wool  it is actually very thin and lightweight. i didn't find it to be scratchy.  .  i am a size xl  but in this blouse the large fit fine. the narrowest part of this blouse is the width of the shoulders  everything else is very voluminous. for this reason  it doesn't flatter my full figure; it makes me look much heavier than i am. my only options are to return it  or bring it to a local seamstress who,Trend
1,So  i really like the plaid designs by siyu. i saw these pants and questioned whether they would be tight and scratchy and ill fitting  but they were so cute  i had to find out. i'm really glad i did. the wool is soft and actually a little stretchy. it has an elastic waist  which is a plus  because sometimes  even if the legs fit  the waist is too small  or vice versa. i am a large  and very curvy on the bottom  and these are perfect and flattering  and the elastic waist is just right. as on the,Trend
1,I love this coat! it does run a bit large. i am 5'2  125 pounds and usually  wear a petite in most retailer clothes. i ordered a small  but wish that i would have ordered the xs. the length of the jacket is fine  but the arms are very long. i think that i might have the arm length hemmed  but it looks ok rolled up too.,Trend
1,I would have liked it but it was too small for me.,Trend
1,Oh this is so much prettier in person! what you can't see from the pics is that the bottom flutes out a bit. it is quite charming. fits true to size.,Trend
1,"This is a beautiful dress for fall. the fabric is gorgeous and drapey and the skirt is swingy. i ordered this in an xl because that size always sells out first. i think a l might fit a bit better  so i will see if any more come in and order another to compare. it poofs out in the back above the elastic and the waist slides down a bit. it is also very long  i need to hem it about 3-4"". i never know which size to order with this brand  i vary between l and xl.",Trend
1,This skirt is really adorable  but only if you're going to tuck in your tops. the pockets flare out at the top  so shirts don't lay correctly on them. instead the bottom of the shirt floofs out and looks really dumpy. tucked in though  super cute!    the waist is really tiny and the fabric has no stretch to speak of. i usually take a 0/2 pant or 25/26 jean. i ordered the xsmall and could only get the top fastened by really sucking it in and struggling. i'll be exchanging for a small  hopefully t,Trend
