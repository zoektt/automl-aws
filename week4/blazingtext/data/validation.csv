__label__-1 "man this dress is the worst . i do n't understand how it looks the way it does on the model . agree with previous reviewer - there must be a minimum of 200 pins pulling the waves and waves of extra fabric back . this dress looks so cute but is so so so disappointing in person . sweater collar and cuffs - stiff and bulky . dress - billowy and sack-like - not sure how they got a belt to pull it all in . save yourself the return and do not get sucked in by the sale price and extra sale discount like"

__label__0 "yes it 's a swing top just like many of the other swing tops retailer is offering this season . i find this silhouette unflattering on me being top heavy so i was frustrated to discover the swing-ness only after i ordered it and it arrived at my house . it also runs huge with big gaping arm holes . the sleeves are cute and fluttered . the black panels on the sides are semi-sheer . it is a pretty boxy top which the photo does n't seem to capture . order at least a size smaller than usual ."
__label__0 "this is definitely a personal preference review . i loved this dress when i tried it on . it 's really beautiful . however there was just way too much fabric on the sleeves for me . i know it 's the style and i have similar style dresses but i felt really large in this dress and it all came down to the sleeves for me ."

__label__-1 "the lace and fit were good . but the length seemed awkward to me given how boxy and flowy-ish the dress is . it felt like a baby doll with sleeves or something . and i hated the outside middle material hated it . it felt cheap and odd when compared to the lace . maybe i was just not in the right demographic for this piece ."
__label__0 "very pretty dress and nicely made ( the embroidery is quite lovely and double lining as mentioned by the other reviewers is awesome ) but not a good shape for me and my hourglass figure . like a lot of swing dresses it has no structure and it 's not a good look on someone a little busty as i am . in all honesty i thought the sack-like shape of the dress made me look 20 lbs heavier than i am . i am a medium size 6-8 and took the 8 based on the other reviews . i probably could have sized down to"

__label__-1 "just not cute . i do n't know how else to describe this top . i am a 34dd and ordered a large . it fit and was comfortable but the peplum had way too much fabric it actually made me look much bigger than i am . i would possibly have tried a medium but it was n't in store so i returned ."

__label__0 "i ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom . it is too pricey to live up to my expectations . it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you ca n't see in the pictures . this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap . it is made of viscose and dry clean only . the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion . if it had been real silk or another natural fiber ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me ."

__label__0 "tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split so any movement reveals most of your arm shoulders . which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office ( yes i could wear a sweater or blazer with it but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top . ) why retailer ? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc . but the split sleeves make it a no-go ."
__label__-1 "the design is very flattering and holiday appropriate . but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used . although figure flattering the zipper is so cheap that -- it runs along the left side -- it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress . and the rough cheap poly is not worth what they 're asking for it . maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail"

__label__0 "i had reservations about this top based on other reviews but it looked cute on the model so i took my chances . i have an athletic build -- not model-thin but not dumpy either -- and this top made me look very frumpy and matronly . the sleeves were especially unflattering . i purchased it in an ps and might have done better with a pxs ."
__label__-1 "this shirt was just really missing something for me . i originally liked the patter of the small dots all over the fabric especially with the sleeves being more sheer than the rest of the blouse . i also am tending to gravitate toward clothes that hide my residual baby fat in my midsection . however the tie is very high up on the neck and it made me feel like i was wearing a turtleneck . i rarely wear turtle necks because they make me feel like i am choking . in addition the bow seemed to be too t"
__label__0 "i coveted this dress for so long but this was a case of the photo giving me a different visual impression than seeing it in real life . the gold patterns on top are n't shiny and delicate in person as i had imagined and they actually make a very strong impression up close ( and are painted on it seems ) . the mesh they lay on is also more coarse than i had hoped . the coolest part about this dress though is the shiny sequined black underlay . the photo does n't do that component justice . i was s"

__label__0 "i love the cold shoulder trend and this top seemed to satisfy . i bought it in the blue which is really more like a very light mint green . however i think the material is pretty thin ( though soft ) and the keyhole sleeve area right by the twist is not substantial so it looks a little cheap . i ordered the small but i think i could have definitely sized down to the xs ( 110 pounds 32dd ) . it 's very loose fitting but i would n't say it looks bad . it 's just a very relaxed fit . for the price thou"

__label__0 "i 'm surprised other reviewers loved this one so much . it 's completely different then how it looks on the model . it 's much shorter which others do mention but it flares a lot . enough to feel maternity-ish on me . it looks fitted on the model . maybe it 's my shape i have a short torso and carry weight in my hips . i ordered an xs too . i will say the material is very nice and it 's well made but it 's going back ."

__label__1 "when i received this blouse ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky . some of the fabric would stick to these dots . i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid . however after hanging on my closet door the dots are still sticky . i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me ."

__label__0 "this is indeed a very flattering dress and looks great - unless you move in it . the fabric shows every little lump and bump on your body as you move and clings to tights ( only a little but just enough to make it annoying ) . if you have any jiggle at all i 'd steer clear . would have definitely kept it if the fabric were different because the cut is amazing but alas ."

__label__-1 "do n't get me wrong this is probably cute on someone else but not me . i looked in the mirror and just laughed it was that bad . so if you 're considering getting this size down . ordered mine in large and it looks like i 'm wearing a barrel . the pink is pretty but the horizontal striping did nothing for my shape . the fabric is soft . i 'm just over trying peplums ."
__label__1 "this dress is light airy easy and comfortable to wear . i love the colors and pattern . it looks wonderful with or without a belt . i sized down from a 6 to a 4. i position the front of the dress material closer to the neck so it flows longer at the back . although i am a size 6 the under slip fits perfectly in a size 4. i prefer the dress without a belt but it also looks good with a belt or a jacket or long cardigan . this dress is a keeper !"
__label__0 "bought these for the color however these just did not work for me . the 26 was too small and the 27 was baggy . i 'm 5 ' 3 and typically wear a 26. beautiful color and good denim . if you are looking for a looser fit more of a straight leg fit ... this is a good jean with a fun pop of color ."

__label__1 "i find it very hard to find a dress . never like the way they look on me .. this one ? ? ? ? fits like a glove flatters my silhouette ( which is difficult because even though i am at a good weight my waist is never small ) . looks like million bucks on me .... i love it ! ! !"
__label__0 "the material is soft and the pattern is pretty but it fits like a sack . it 's too bad that this was n't more form-fitting with some stretch and a zipper because its fit is just not beautiful . for tall very slender ladies this will be pretty as it is in the photo . it fit me just fine ( with a little extra room on top ) but it went right back into the bag without a thought ."
__label__-1 "this shirt is not near as nice as it may look the fabric is just ok it runs large i ordered a xs and the neck line was huge and gaping not worth the money even on sale"

__label__1 "i could live in this top : it 's versatile enough to be dressed up or down or worn as a bottom layer ; the color offerings are basic enough to match anything ; and it 's comfortable enough to wear around the clock . note that it runs small . i had to size up to a medium even though 80 % of everything else i wear is size small ."
__label__1 "i actually ended up buying two of these dresses . i took the first one to the dry cleaner and they chewed up the slip and put a hole in the dress . i was so sad that i went and bought a second one before they could sell out . the good news is that it was on sale ! this is an awesome light and airy dress that is great for those hot summer days . i pretty much wear it every opportunity i get . for reference i purchased the small . it 's loose but the shoulders armholes and slip all fit perfectly . i weigh"

__label__-1 "this top is huge ! i 'm typically a size 2 or 4. i bought the 2 and its huge . it 's wider than it is long . even if i sized down to a 0 it would still be too much fabric . i 'm so disappointed ! beautiful color and fabric but there 's so much fabric . i love a flowy top but this one is way too much . : ( i will be returning this top ."
__label__-1 "i love the coh fleetwood jeans and since i was looking for a pair of not-so-skinny skinny jeans i thought these would be great . but unlike the fleetwoods which are a substantial weight denim these are very soft -- too soft -- and bag out in the first 5 minutes . the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering . maybe if you 're looking for jeans you can lounge in these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats ."

__label__0 "i liked this dress so much in the store - but did n't have it in my size - so had it shipped ( and yes paid shipping costs ... ) but it just did n't work on my body . the top is sort of poofy for lack of a better word - it made me look kind of poofy all over and really - i am not poofy ! it 's a lovely color - and might look terrific on a tall woman - but at 5 ' 3 - not so good - had to return sadly ."

__label__-1 "i was so excited to try this on in the store because i 've had my eye on it online . unfortunately it is not like the picture . the material is very thin almost translucent . i also could not figure out how it get it on ! the cape has short sleeves not long as it appears in the picture and the folds of fabric would not drape quite right in the front . love the look of black design on white . hopefully retailer can redo this in a thicker cape for the fall but for now i 'll skip this one ."

__label__0 "i love the design of this blouse and the pattern but the colors are a bit darker than in the photo . the quality is pretty poor . i feel like its a snag away from being ruined and thrown away and for this price it is just not worth the purchase . sending it back : ( it comes with a tank top ; just to let others know ."
__label__-1 "i thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style but i returned it immediately . it runs so large ! the colors are faded and the trim of the shirt curl over so it looks cheap and frumpy . i do not recommend this ! it hits in all the wrong places ."

__label__-1 "i wanted to love this dress - and did from the picture online . when it arrived the black already looked faded and old . also the embroidery looks like a grandma but not in a cute vintage way . the fabric is stiff which causes a boxy unflattering look . had to return it ."

__label__0 "the fabric is beautiful even the lining is lovely . i ordered the green color in a large as i 'm curvy and have long arms . but it just does n't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure even though it 's a lapel and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs and just looked frumpy . it looks much more tailored on the model . too bad as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time ."
__label__0 "overall a very nice and unique dress . it does have too much going on but can be worn in a versatile way and if you are small chested without a bra . i am not a big fan of the material i wish it was softer . it definitely has a gypsie/bohemian look if that is what you are looking for !"
__label__-1 "so this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer . this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute . it looked a million times cuter in the photos ."
__label__-1 "i love how these jeans look on . tts adorable . i exchanged my first pair due to stitching coming out in the back right pocket . pair # 2 -the stitching came out in the exact same place . this seems to be a problem with the quality/sewing . the fact that the stitching is gold and decorative as well as functional means it will keep unraveling until the jeans are ruined . 2nd pair has to go back . too bad ."
__label__1 "gorgeous skirt . runs a bit big . well made . perfect for the office and super comfy ."
__label__-1 "i loved the fact that this dress is cotton . it is a thin cotton and you can see in the photos that she is wearing a black slip with a thicker strap . mine came with a nude slip . i 'm thinking they all come with a nude slip . i 'm not sure why they showed the dress with the black thick strap slip unless it was to show the dress as a thicker cotton than what it actually is . the dress is adorable though which makes it hard for me to decide whether to keep it and hope mine wo n't tear easily or to retur"
__label__-1 "although beautiful colors this eyelet dress is quite heavy and the buttons have no give- one of them literally cracked when i tried to unbutton it . unbuttoning it was difficult due to the tight weave . it just misses the mark and will be going back ."
__label__-1 "it 's a fine dress but it definitely runs small and it 's actually a lot shorter than i was expecting especially since i 'm only 5 ' 3"
__label__0 "i wanted so badly for this dress to work on me . the design is amazing . the detail is so pretty and delicate . its my version of the perfect little black dress ! however i have very big arms ... and while i could have easily sized down for the body of the dress the arms and chest in my normal size did not fit at all . i 'm usually a 14-16 in dresses . i tried the 16 and it just did n't work . the arms were way too tight . however i 've seen this dress on many other women with smaller arms than me and they"
__label__0 "you guys i love this so much ! however within one hour of wearing it the back seam completely ripped . it fit me perfectly ... sadly i & # 39 ; ll have to return the damaged item . really sad it & # 39 ; s all sold out too !"
__label__0 "hangs terribly off the chest . tent-like . looks maternity . no thanks ."
__label__0 "i wear an 8-10 and these are a little big on me which is surprising . they also do n't lay really flat in the back . the pockets are inside in the back in side two layers and do n't lay very flat . the crotch is low and rides up when i walk . i 'll probably wear them again but i 'm not totally thrilled by them ."
__label__1 "love this top . great twist on a traditional plaid . looks great with skinny jeans or leggings . i get compliments on it every time i wear it ."
__label__-1 "this material is a nice quality but the shirt is boxy and shapeless . it was not flattering at all on my shape . i do n't think it would look nice on anyone with an hourglass shape or fuller chest ."
__label__1 "just received this gorgeous blouse and i could n't be happier ! it 's stunning ! not sheer at all but light and breezy . i typically wear a medium sometimes a small but i ordered the medium since velvet tends to be a little tight in the shoulders on me . this medium is a little roomy so it fits more like a tunic - which is what i 've been looking for all spring . the blue is even prettier in person - a true blue . a perfect find !"
__label__1 "i 'm barely 5 ' 4 and rarely find a maxi that is n't far too long or the other extreme . i prefer mine to just barely reach the ground as opposed to rising 5 inches from the floor for example . this one is perfect with flat sandals . i tried on the 4 and chuckled b/c it was 6 too long . tried on the 2 and not only was it the perfect length the bodice fit like a glove . i would say i 'm average bust size always fluctuating but not generally flat-chested . i prefer more conservative sleeveless dresses an"

__label__-1 "so these look so good online - i love flare and the button detail . however on me they were very long ( which i knew ) but too thigh-hugging for my taste and the buttons looked cheap ( i ordered the tan color ) . thus back they went . for reference i am 5 ' 5 and 125 # and ordered the 6 ."
__label__1 "so cozy and warm great for the cold nights !"
__label__-1 "love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected . it is soft to the skin and flattering . however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders ."
__label__-1 "i have been looking at this sweater online since it first came out and i finally ordered it when it was 40 % off . i ordered a size m petite sadly when it arrived and i tried it on it was very boxy stiff like and did not flow like it looked on the model online so i sent it back ."
__label__0 "this very lightweight cardigan looked like an eggplant color online . it 's brown with a hint of burgandy . not bad but unexpected . i am very short -waisted and this lies very high on my torso . the seams are unfinished and it looks cheaply made . glad i got this on sale ."
__label__-1 "it seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment . however i found the band to be extremely small and tight . it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin ."
__label__1 "i bought this top to match a maxi skirt and it was pretty close to perfect . i got the blue color which is more of a brighter blue than a navy . i 'm 6ft and wear a 10 top but got this in a large hoping to gain some length in the torso out of the of a large and could have gone a size down . the top was definitely long enough and i did n't have the problems with the gaping at the hook that other reviewers had . this is probably because i went a little larger in the sizing and i have a very small"
__label__0 "i really really wanted to love this jacket . unfortunately i have a long torso and it was a weird length on me . it hit touching my waist and i wanted something a little longer . i am 5 ' 6 but long waisted . this probably fits beautifully on someone more short-waisted or petite in stature . it was beautiful ( although the buttons were cheap ... )"
__label__-1 "boxy short & wide ! luv this brand but super disappointed with this design ..."
__label__-1 "the material is horrible it 's heavy and cheap . the skirt does not flow as it appears in the photo . instead the bottom part of the skirt just stands out like ruffles . am returning ."
__label__0 "i ordered the white tee in xs and am returning it . it runs tts & had a good fit but i did n't like the material at all . maybe because it was white but it was see through & like a tissue tee that i would expect to get little holes in it near the waist . the sleeves are gathered in the center of the sleeve & i did n't like the way that looked ."
__label__-1 "i did not like this cashmere sweater at all . i ordered the pink which was more of a peach color . although the color was very pretty the material was very thin and cheap looking . it was also very short . not worth the money even at 40 % off ."
__label__0 "this top is a nice color and soft material but is much more of a swing top style than i was looking for . i will return it but it could be ideal for someone who wants a very loose fitting casual look ."
__label__1 "women who want some flutter without too much fullness"
__label__-1 "in a word .. clingy ... and not in good way . long so you need it to flow not cling . liked the back but front was just too clingy . back it goes ."
__label__1 "this shirt is very comfortable to wear mostly because the buttons are well placed . many button down shirts bother me because they gape open at the bust area but the buttons on this one are placed at just the right spot ."
__label__0 "the fit is quite strange on me as the tie is very high on the waist . this makes the jacket look odd and quite voluminous . i was very impressed with the fabric though but will have to return . i wish retailer would post what size is the model wearing . maybe she is wearing a larger size than usual which falls lower ."
__label__1 "prior reviewer nailed it with the summary of this dress . it definitely needs heels . i 'm 5 ' 4 120 # 34d and this is a size 36. i usually wear a size s or 4 with most retailer stuff ."
__label__-1 "when i saw this online i wondered why this dress cost so much . i have been keeping my eye on it for some time . loved what i saw the design and colors and details at the neckline and waist along with pockets but was skeptical . i was waiting for a sale to take a dive and here are my thoughts when i got it : ___________ pros : - the colors you see online are exactly the same in person . - the jeweled neckline is lovely . it 's one thing that drew me to it . this dress had a very sophisticated appeal wh"
__label__1 "yes ! yes ! yes ! i buy a lot of dresses from retailer and about once a year i hit the jackpot with a dress that hits all the marks ! this dress is it ! i bought the white linen version on a whim . i never buy white dress because 1. i do n't want to look bigger than my pear shape already is and 2. i like red wine and i that 's risky in a white dress ! i do n't know how this designer did it but this dress is amazing ! it 's slimming and flattering and summery and current . and i am two sizes bigger"
__label__1 "really like the quality color and overall design of these jeans . they ran a little long on me but i just cut off an inch from the bottom and they fit perfectly with some tall booties . i did n't need to get them altered because the design of them is that they are cut at the bottom and are a little frayed . so glad that was the case given the price tag on them . i am 5 ' 7 128 lbs and wear a size 28 which fit perfectly except for the length which was easily fixed . definitely recommend these jeans"
__label__-1 "this suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal . it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out . i was very sad to return it : ( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium"
__label__-1 "really unattractive shirt . nothing good i can say about it . horrible fit . i ca n't imagine this would look good on anyone ."
__label__0 "i liked the look of the tunic sweater and it was very soft . i am 5 ' 7 115 lbs and tried on the xs . the arms felt a bit tight but overall it fit well and i liked the length . i did not like how high the hem was split though- i would ideally like to wear these with a pair of leggings and wish the hem was split just a little lower and not right at my hip . the material was very soft but i felt like it was a bit cheap for the price ."
__label__1 "i actually like this better on the instagram picture than on the model ... anyway i ordered the xs petite ( for 115 lbs 5 ' 1.5 ) and it fits really nicely . not too short . the material is nice and soft nad looks like it may not wrinkles which would be a bonus ... the little gold buttons are super cute but you ca n't really wear this untied so it is pretty much a strictly tied short . sleeves are flattering ... i think i may keep it : - )"
__label__-1 "i 'm 5 ' 2-5 ' 3 which is supposed to be the max height for pieties in retailer ( former employee ) and while the bodice hit right the skirt was insanely long . not even with heels is this gon na be right . and no discount towards hemming ? i 'll wait until this hits the sale rack which it will because concensus is it 's way too long ."
__label__-1 "there is no way this is worth the price . i was deeply disappointed when it arrived . the material is thin and feels cheap . i love the design and anna sui but this is just so overpriced ."
__label__0 "definitely pj quality . i have a fairly thin frame and this hung on me like a tent . and it 's very thin so it works as a swim cover but definitely not a dress for anything else ."
__label__-1 "i am petite ( 5 ' ) . even the xsmall petite looked sloppy on me . i also disliked the nude fabric under the lace- it made it look cheap . i wanted this to be the perfect lbd i just could n't make it work on my body ."
__label__0 "i tried the yellow striped dress on in the store and it is completely sheer ."
__label__-1 "this skirt is beautiful . fabric is gorgeous with perfect amount of shine and luxury to it . there is a life in this skirt ; it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way . or i better say it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it . unfortunately it stretched more than a full size and generally lost its shape . now the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore ."
__label__0 "this top looks real cute on the model ! wish it looked like that on me ! way too big so not flattering on my petite frame . sadly going back !"
__label__1 "absolutely gorgeous ! i bought my regular size m and while it 's a little wide in the shoulders it drapes beautifully . because i 'm so short i found the sleeves too long so i took it to my dressmaker and she shortened the sleeves about two inches so it 's still elbow length and while i was there she put in two small darts in the back so make it less boxy for my frame . ca n't wait to wear it - it 's a beautiful material and i love the combo of the metallic sheen and velvet . so elegant . very gatsby"
__label__0 "bought this in the store and fell in love with it . very soft and flattering to wear . however after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill . this truly is a beautiful sweater but i fear it will not be beautiful for long . i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale ."
__label__1 "i love this dress for it 's unique design with the crochet features . it is super comfortable great for being layered without see through . i ordered a small though and it is still too large for me . i have been trying to decide on returning it since i love it so much . i 'd recommend sizing down for this dress . i 'm 5 ' 6 '' 135lbs and still needed an xs which seems a bit off . i guess i 'm used to retailer running a bit big but i miss judge this one and hate to deal with the mailing and worrying"
__label__0 "they were ok pants but too small . the texture and shape were not what i expected either ."
__label__-1 "this is a really cute dress just did not look flattering on me at all . i suppose i could have gone down a size however i just did not love it . i am 5 ' 3 130 # athletic build 36dd . i read the other reviews and everyone loves this dress . here is what i did not like . there are pockets which i can not figure out the purpose that lay oddly all bunched up right at the hips . due to the shape of the dress it bunches out . on my short frame it made me look shorter and wider . the fabric is a lightwei"
__label__0 "i tried on the grey version in store and it was significantly longer than pictured . the back came down to just below my knee which looked awkward with the split sides . i am 5 ' 4 and this was a regular ( not petite ) size . however the overall quality of the fabric was good and it seemed durable ."
__label__0 "love the way this dress looks online . sadly it does n't look great on me . i 'm 5 ' 4 athletic build . the small fit perfectly but the extra fabric in the hip/pocket area just seemed to drag me down . i really wished this worked for me but i think you 've got ta be a little bit taller to pull this one off ."
__label__-1 "this shirt looks nothing like the fit in the pictures . it is short and very wide . i had read the previous reviews and thought i could take it in on the sides some but it is literally the shape of a trapezoid ."
__label__-1 "this dress is gorgeous as displayed at store . color is vibrant but the one i ordered looked dull and wrinkles very easily . i wore it to a ceremony and the seatbelt left me wrinkled before i arrived . the top is very wide and best to wear strapless ."
__label__0 "this top is beautiful but beware there is a lot of extra material on the sides . it was not flattering on only because of all the excess fabric . clearly the model in the picture has it pinned behind her . it would be a keeper if it was cut closer to the body but sadly it 's going back ."
__label__-1 "there were no reviews it 's an online exclusive and thought it might look good with a nice skirt at an upcoming wedding . the spandex jersey back looks like sweat shirt material . on the white version of this it is mismatched with an oatmeal color and white that just looks awful . as a busty 36d i was stunned to find myself swimming in a medium . it does not look like the photograph and the sleeve billow out . i feel like this had to have been clipped and tucked in for this photograph . i 'm an anth"

__label__-1 "it 's the inverted invert ... not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore ."
__label__-1 "this dress looks lovely on the model but it looks just awful on me ! i am 5 ' 4 and curvy . the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape . instead of a cap sleeve it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders . it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space . the material is nice and the sequins are pretty but the cut of the dress is unflattering ."
__label__-1 "i was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it 's going back because the knit is just too thin . i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it 's not . and because it 's so light the swing effect does n't really come off . nothing special ."
__label__-1 "i ordered a size 16 in the orange . it ran a size smaller than normal size 16 maeve tops . the quality of the material was terrible . it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath . that messes with the look of the lace on the top . the color of the orange was gorgeous ."
__label__-1 "the tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes . to my surprise the tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest area . the appliques/laces on the front are made of low quality materials ."

__label__-1 "this dress is beautiful and extremely well made ... if you can get into it . the only way to close the dress is a line of difficult to button buttons up the back . it 's form fitting so you 'd better be on your yoga a game or have a loved one or hand maiden to lend a hand . i thought about taking it to a tailor to install a hidden side zipper but it 's soooo form fitting i 'm afraid i would n't wear it ."
__label__1 "this dress is easy to wear lined and feels like it could be a wonderful summer staple . i love that it 's so colorful . but for some reason the pops of color on the white background did not look great on my very pale skin . i 'm sure on someone else this will be beautiful . i also thought it ran just slightly large in the bust ( although to be fair i am small-chested ) ."
__label__0 "i really like the color of this and the feel but that is where it ends . it does not come with the gorgeous flattering belt that it is pictured with and is cut without shape so it does not fit to your body and show off any glorious womanly curves . i could purchase the belt with it but i do n't prefer to purchase products that can not stand on their own ."
__label__1 "this skirt is not only cute but really comfy . i really like the materials it 's made of and the way it seems to hug my body in a flattering way . i 'm 5 ' 2 so the only down side is that i wish it came in petite but i still kept it because it looked great hitting me right above my knees and high at my waist . love this skirt !"

__label__1 "i sadly only noticed this top once on sale . i tried on the xs and it was just a bit big i would need the petite so i had to leave it behind ( 115 lbs 30dd ) - but it is adorable can be dressed up and classy casually with jeans or sweetly so many ways ... love the subtle polka dots ... oh well i am sure i will find something similar i love !"
__label__0 "sooo this adorable blouse is indeed different than pictured . no ruffle such a bummer sleeves are much longer and yes it 's teared in the front and back . also the button opening on the back is much longer/larger in my opinion . i 'll most likely keep it but consider the mentioned if buying ."
__label__0 "the material deep color and design are gorgeous . however the dress is just too bulky for my 5 ' 2 and 110lb frame . i ordered a 0p and it just was n't flattering on me . it 's somewhat tent-shaped so the fact that it 's not at all fitted and has a thick lining made me look larger than i actually am . i 'm so disappointed because the dress really is beautiful otherwise ."
__label__-1 "i loved everything about this dress . the fit the style and the ability to wear in the fall . i wore it once washed it in gentle/hand-wash cycle in cold water and laid it out flat to dry- per the instructions- and it shrank at least a full size . it 's going back . i am so sad as i said earlier i really loved this dress ."

__label__1 "these give an amazing slimming effect and i love the dark wash and fit on the waist . only negative is that being 5 ' 4 and a size 30 the length of the pants is a few inches too long for me . i still love them but will have to wear heels with them always ."

__label__-1 "i am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards . this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago ! poor quality in cut fabric design . this is a top one would grab at a local box store for 19.99. the colors are not as vibrant . the shoulders ill fitted . and the fabric and threads are very cheap . i was expecting so much more.sorry retailer ..... my favorite store to shop !"
__label__0 "this is a well made blouse with a pretty neckline . the print with the sleeves makes me look really wide . it 's an odd look ."
__label__0 "i expected this dress to be a much better fit and quality overall -- the size small fit me fine -- i 'm about 140 and small in the chest but the zipper was incredibly cheap and the dress could 've draped in a more attractive way . if this dress could be in cotton and given more consideration to the fit and drape it 'd be worth it but it 's going back ."
__label__-1 "the top fits nice but after one wear ( did n't even washed it ) the fabric was all fuzzy . would not recommend it ."
__label__-1 "oh dear . the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me -- it made it look so cheap . i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip . instead it 's a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic . it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist making it a no-go for me ."
__label__0 "i really thought from the picture that the dress would be more fit for a curvy figure . it is unfortunately more well suited to those women with straighter lines . the color was more flat than the picture as well but i bet it is lovely in navy ."
__label__0 "i purchased this dress to wear to a beach wedding . i loved the color the fit and the style . i even got a lot of compliments on it . the problem was that the wedding was on the beach in florida 85 degree weather and when you are sweating the fabric changes colors and takes a really really long time to return to normal ! unfortunately i had to return it . would be great to wear indoors just watch getting water or anything else on it !"
__label__-1 "as a tall girl i was thrilled to see that these pants come in longs ! they are amazing for dressing up ( or sassing up ) and outfit . i anxiously anticipated their arrival and wore them the very first night i bought them . however as someone previously mentioned the quality is poor . after wearing them to they symphony the knee tore while i was sitting in my seat ! i really do n't see a way to avoid this from happening since i had not moved . i 'm sooo upset because i absolutely loved these pants !"

__label__0 "the color and embellishment of this top are beautiful . this would look great on anyone super lean otherwise you just look really wide as there is no frame in the torso of this top at all . the back picture shows it well . i am 5 ' 9 142 lbs and i ordered the small and medium and both were huge ! with regrets going back ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this top on line . i wanted to love it but unfortunately the fit was not for me . i am 5 ' 9 with a long torso . this top was cut very wide and looks like a maternity top ."
__label__0 "i found the dot print in the store and though the pattern was cute but when i tried it on i just had to wonder - who actually looks good in this style ? it fits like a sack big and puffy in the middle but tapered at the hem . it creates the exact opposite on an hourglass shape . genuinely puzzled that anyone would look good in this style . to bad i hope they use these cute colors and prints on a style with some waist-definition next time ."
__label__-1 "this top is beautiful online and in person . i am in no way a large full figured gal but i did order an xl . reading the past review and wanting an airy fit i ordered a larger size . this shirt is horribly tiny in person ! the xl regular fit looked like an xs . have no idea if this particular shirt sent to me was miss sized or what . will take back . other than fit the shirt is very beautiful in every way ."

__label__0 "i was excited to buy this sweater based on the online pictures . although the ombre coloring is beautiful in person i did not like the metallic trim at waist & cuffs . the pictures do n't really show the extreme brightness of the trim . it looks literally like xmas ribbons were sewn into the sweater . to me it looked like something a child would wear . i ordered the 1 which was the smallest size offered . it is oversized without much shape and i felt it added bulk around the middle ."
__label__0 "i was so excited for this coat when i saw it in the catalog but disappointed when it got to stores . the faux fur pictured both here and in the catalog looked much more of a burnt red brown color than the straight up maroon that it actually is in store . i 'd say it even looks a bit purple . the nice thing is that it is detachable and you can replace it with something else if you really do n't like the color . i have decided to buy it anyways because the fit of the coat is lovely and simply stunning ."
__label__0 "while i had high hopes for this dress to be my go to unfortunately o could n't get passed how cheap the material felt . the cut and pattern both worked on my petite frame however the cut out pieces in front are not lines and exposed the top portion of my bra ."
__label__-1 "i wish i had read the reviews before purchasing online . i love how this top looks online but when i tried on the small that i ordered it was comical . so so boxy . literally shaped like a square . it must be pinned back on this model . maybe if i ordered an xxxxs it would have worked ... or perhaps for a larger person it may look super cute ! just did n't work on my slim build . : ("
__label__1 "the color and fabric are really soft and lovely . it runs big so you can get away with a size smaller of even 2 sizes smaller . it would look great paired with leggings and boots and a long sweater coat or with skinny jeans and sandals . this is going to be my new favorite ."

__label__0 "i bought the blue dress though the blue dress was a little more like grey according to my husband and i. the quality of the fabric was quite nice . i have to return the dress because it does not fit me around the bust . i consider myself to have a good size bust ( not huge ) but the dress seems to expect quite a bit smaller . i was initially attracted to the dress because it looked a little more casual which is what i wanted but i guess i just would n't call it at all pretty ."

__label__-1 "this dress makes me so sad ... the textured stretchy fabric color length and overall swingy fit are spot on . as another reviewer noted though the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress . the neck is tiny which i could have gotten over once it was on but the arm holes were just awful - too big all around ( too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut ) . basically you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes . it could have been so good but alas but t"

__label__1 "i thought this dress was lovely on . i 'm an 8/10 and tried the med which i believe was the right fit . it may have fit a little large but i liked the way it hung . it has pockets and the color is absolutely beautiful . definitely buying if it makes it to sale ."
__label__0 "this is a beautiful top however it looks better on the 80 pound model . the shirt sits awkward on your chest if you have any cleavage and there is way too much fabric around the body . if you are any size beyond a 2 then it just makes you look bigger than you are ."
__label__1 "a really beautiful well made dress . runs extremely big though ! i 'm not petite by any means and ordered a large but i 'm positively swimming in it . an oversized look works for this particular dress but i think it 's supposed to be more fitted so i would recommend sizing down from what you might normally expect for a piece of this style ."
__label__-1 "i was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper looks like crusty white rust . see attached pictures . the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance ! retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers . lately the quality has been declining a"

__label__1 "obsessed with this sweatshirt ! it 's a must have for any loungewear lover . i 'm normally a xs but sized up to a s for a more loose relaxed look . i was afraid it would swallow me but i love the fit ! the knot in the front is a nice detail that makes this comfy top really cute . the fabric is a great texture great for transitioning from summer to fall and winter to spring . love everything about this sweatshirt and will easily pair with leggings or jeans . worth every penny ! ! !"
__label__1 "fits true to size and rides the line between contemporary and retro exceptionally well ."
__label__-1 "fits like a maternity top . not for my age group or build ."
__label__-1 "after reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale . i 'm tall and lean but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures . firstly the top has a strange transition to the skirt with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together . if you blouse it and lay flat it invariably gets bunched as you wear it . this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks creating less clean lines . i also found the blue black"
__label__-1 "i am normally a straightforward 10 - since i saw the other review i ordered down to an 8 - i am still swimming in it.i would say i have about 4 inches of extra fabric in the waist/hips . this is sized way too large . i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool - but i wo n't find out cause i 'm returning it ? on the bright side i might fit a 6 which would be pretty nice ."
__label__-1 "the color design and fabric of this top ( got it in the red ) were just as i expected but as the owner of several deletta brand tops i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank . not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes and the top just hangs on me . it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large . bummed to return it because i really love the color and the style . will try an x-s"
__label__-1 "i purchased this swimsuit in the mint . gorgeous color combination . i 'm 5 ' 5 and weigh 117 lbs . i purchased a small . the fit is true to size . i love the front design ; however my husband promptly brought the back of the swimsuit to my attention . the chevron was off center . the design should have been centered with my back ; however it was on the right side of my back . i immediately called retailer assuming the product was defective . the item was sold out on line ; however a supervisor was able to l"
__label__1 "absolutely love this little shift ! ! ! i bought it on a whim really . it just harkened back to my crushed velvet loving days of the 80 's ! crushed velvet then was just something fuzzy that had been run over by a car and maybe thrown up on a few times at a punk rock bar : - ) this is not that sort of velvet . it 's also not some cheap polyester looking knock-off of true velvet . i always find those to have a somewhat plastic sheen to them . that is exactly what i was worried about judging from the pictur"
__label__1 "this blouse is exactly what i wanted and the fit is great . silk is always light and can go with jeans or dress up with a skirt . i 'm wearing mine to a baby shower in a few weeks ."
__label__-1 "i finally found this dress in store today and wow ! i can not believe this cheap looking dress is from ms ! they have been among the top at retailer and this unlined baggy cheap velvet sub is a shock ! what happened ? only the color is nice . please get back to yourself ms !"
__label__1 "feminine and lovely flutters indeed . i am on the fence . i ordered in a petite - had to size down - and something about bust and arm holes not completely right . given the light and airiness of this tank it does not seem right to have to wear a camisole underneath which is what it would need for work wear ."
__label__1 "i loved this top when i first saw it . i tried on my usual size l and there is no stretch through the bust so it totally flattened my chest . a few weeks ago i noticed there were some xl 's that must have been returned . i tried them on and they fit perfectly ! i suggest sizing up if you have a chest this is a very flattering top and it looks great paired with scarves as a wrap skinny jeans and boots ."
__label__1 "this dress is adorable . it 's very comfortable and so flattering . the only thing is i ca n't understand why it is priced so high . it 's a great dress but i 'm just not convinced it 's the worth the price tag . i 'm going to watch for it to go on sale . fingers crossed !"
__label__1 "fun transitional dress for fall that can be worn with ballet flats boots or booties . true to size . for reference i am 5 ' 9 138 with an athletic build ."
__label__0 "i loved this at first .... but the quality is awful ! it pilled like crazy and started to get little holes near the neck after 4-5 wears . second sweater from retailer this year with severe pilling issues . i love retailer but will never again buy another sweater here ."
__label__-1 "the picture makes the shorts look structured . i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material . i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester . also this runs way too big . i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs . i would n't even buy this at the sale price ."
__label__1 "i am so amazed that i finally found the perfect straight legged denim ! not too skinny nor too tight b/c i have athletic calves . i have been waiting a long time ! for reference i took a size 26 and usually wear a 2. it is great and comfortable for someone my age ! i love these and they are the best investment ."
__label__1 "i purchased the medium in this sweater as that was all that was left . but it fit like a large if not an xlarge ! it 's a beautifully made sweater and really soft . i now think i know why it suddenly becomes available again here and there . it 's not the kind of sweater you want to wear over sized because as beautifully made as it is it 's not that flattering if it 's hanging on you . luckily it suddenly became available in a small which i quickly ordered and will keep my figures crossed that it 's bette"
